This plugin adds a SQL reformatting task to our favorite IDE. Just install it via it's own [Update Center](http://cismet.github.io/sq-belle/updatecenter/updates.xml) 
or by downloading the [NBM](http://cismet.github.io/sq-belle/downloads/sq-belle-1.0.nbm).

If you see room for improvement, just file an issue or fork the project and send us a pull-request. We would love to collaborate.


Have fun
